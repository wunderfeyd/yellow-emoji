# yellowcms-emoji

Emoji plugin for Yellow CMS

This plugin is going to support different emoji sets, so it does not contain any graphics by itself.

# Installation

Put the `emojis.php` in your Yellow plugin folder `system/plugins`.

Select the emoji set you want to use and put the content in the media folder.

More soon. Work in progress.
